# My OrcaSlicer config

OrcaSlicer forgot my config on update (I still had a backup, so it wasn't too bad), I've wanted
some way to keep track of my changes, and I don't want to keep depending on Bambu Lab's sync feature,
so I've decided to create a custom profile that I can copy or symlink to the configuration folder.

The flatpak configuration location is `~/.var/app/io.github.softfever.OrcaSlicer/config/OrcaSlicer/`.

[How to create profiles (OrcaSlicer's Github wiki).](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/wiki/How-to-create-profiles)
Important part from the wiki, delete the system folder in the configuration folder to clear cache,
and make new profiles appear in the app.

## Repo structure

This repo will contain parts taken generated by OrcaSlicer and [OpenNept4une's profiles](https://github.com/OpenNeptune3D/OpenNept4une/wiki#importing-orcaslicer-profiles), later modified by me.

- [./system](./system) are the Elegoo files generated by OrcaSlicer.
- [./OpenNept4une](./OpenNept4une) are the files obtained from OpenNept4une.
- [./config](./config) are the files I've modified and use in OrcaSlicer.

I've thought about creating fully independent profiles but I think that would be too much work, at
least for now, so I'll just make my profiles depend on the ones included in OrcaSlicer (can be
found in the system folder).
